# ESPHome Samsung HVAC Integration

Welcome to the **ESPHome Samsung HVAC Integration** project! This project provides an [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) component to integrate Samsung HVAC units (air conditioners or heat pumps) seamlessly into Home Assistant. Our goal is to empower users with comprehensive control and monitoring of their HVAC systems using modern, open-source tools.

## 🌟 Overview
This project focuses on Samsung HVAC units that communicate via a dedicated hardware bus (commonly F1/F2, sometimes called R1/R2). Samsung uses two main protocols for communication between indoor and outdoor units:
- **NASA Protocol**: Newer models utilize this more advanced protocol. See: **NASA Protocol Notes** → https://docs.samsung-hvac.aran.net.tr/wiki/nasa/samsung_nasa_protocol/
- **NonNASA Protocol**: Older units often rely on this simpler protocol.

The integration is designed to support both protocols, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of Samsung AC units.

## 📚 Key Features
This integration offers a variety of powerful features:
- **Multisplit Support** for controlling multiple indoor units.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring** with detailed data.
- **Energy Monitoring Sensors** for tracking power consumption.
- **AC Mode and Target Temperature Control**.
- **Real-Time Error Code Monitoring and Notifications**.
